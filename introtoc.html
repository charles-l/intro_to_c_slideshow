# How to Learn C
*An introduction for the high-level programmer*

---

# Prerequisite knowledge

### 1. At least one programming language
Preferably two, because you'll know how to logically solve a problem, but express it in two different ways. *Don't pick C as your first language.*
### 2. Logical thinking
You must be able to break down a problem into simple steps the computer can understand. If you can't think like a computer, you'll have difficulty debugging.
### 3. Time
C isn't a language you'll quickly learn. You'll write programs that don't work right. It takes time before you can quickly spot issues in your code.

---
# Why you should learn C
<small>You only need C for projects that require low-level hardware access or blazing-fast speeds.</small>
### 1. Advanced Game Development (coupled with a good game development framework)
For *advanced* high-performance 3D graphics intensive applications. *<small>You'd better have some math knowledge (linear algebra, calculus and college physics) for that, too.</small>*

### 2. Compilers
Get a book on compiler design for this stuff.

### 3. Embedded Applications
When you're trying to eek out every last bit of performance, you're probably not going to flash your microcontroller with a Ruby interpreter so you can run a script.

---
# Why you should learn C (cont)
### 4. Operating Systems
YAH! LINUX!!! Or your own homebrew OS if you want.

### 5. LINUX
YAH! LINUX!!! Kernel hackering, command line utility development, writing a replacement to systemd, etc.

<br/>
<br/>

If you're looking to write a script that counts the number of occurrences of 'foo' in a text file, you're in the wrong place.

# If you're still sure you want to learn C, take a quick look at a guide to syntax so you have an idea of what's going on.
---
class: center, middle, dark
# This slideshow is to help you learn and understand the more confusing concepts C introduces.
---
class: center, middle, dark

# On to the technical stuff

---
class: center, middle, dark
### Interpreted
vs
### Compiled
---

# Example
### Ruby
As soon as you've finished writing your code, you can run it. The Ruby interpreter will execute the code on the fly:
```bash
ruby test.rb
#=> Yah! Running code!
```
### C
C requires that you **compile** your code to an machine-code executable file first.
```bash
# Compile my shizzle to a new executable called 'test'
cc -o test test.c

# Run my shizzle
./test
```
---

## Advantages
- Easy to redistribute
- Fast
- Automatic obfuscation (they can't read your code!)
- The compiler essentially lints your code

## Disadvantages
- Must be compiled on every architecture
- More difficult to debug

---
class: center, middle, dark
### Dynamic typing
vs
### Static typing
---
# Example
### Ruby
Variables can be anything!
```ruby
my_var = 4 # Look, it's an integer
my_var = 2.0 # Now it's a float
my_var = [1,2,3] # Woah, an array!
my_var = 'a string of stuff' # WORDS! (a.k.a. string)
```
### C
Once you've set the type for your variable, it must stay that way forever.
```c
int my_var = 3; // It's an int!
my_var = "abc"; // COMPILER ERROR! You clearly stated that it was an int!

/* insert explosion here */
```
---
class: center, middle, dark
### Safe
vs
### Unsafe
---
# Example
### Ruby
Ruby's interpreter enforces sanity in your code.
```ruby
a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
a[2]
# => c
a[5] # uh oh
# => Error: idiot programmer attempting to access element that does not exist!
```
### C
In C, you can do whatever the heck you want.
```c
char a[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
a[2]
//=> 'c'
a[5] // Sure! Have some garbage!
//=> ajskdi&E3j ... Error: segfault
```
---
class: center, middle, dark
### Automatic Memory Layout and Garbage Collection
vs
### Manual Memory Layout and Management
---
# Example
### Ruby
```ruby
def my_memory_function
    cats = get_all_teh_images_on_imgur
    process_images(cats) # Whoa, it's is takin up a lot of memory
end # DELETE THE KITTIES
# the cats variable doesn't exist anymore! We now have memory for more things!
```

### C
```c
void my_memory_function() {
    // allocate the memory for a bunch of cat images
    images *cats = malloc(sizeof(cat_image) * NUMBER_OF_CATS_ON_IMGUR);
    get_all_teh_images_on_imgur(cats); // now, we can actually get the images
    process_images(cats);
    // Kitties still live in memory!
    free(cats); // don't forget this, or else this memory will stay reserved for cats
    // oop, now they're gone
}
```

#.biggest[Pointers!]
---
# Pointers
... are foundational to C. They give you great power (so please be careful).

*A pointer is a variable that contains a memory address (probably of another variable).*

In C, a '`*`' denotes a variable as a pointer to whatever data type comes before.

```c
int *i_ptr; // this pointer can point to an integer
float *f_ptr; // this can point to a float
int **ii_ptr; // this pointer points to an int pointer
```

The '`&`' symbol allows you to get the memory location to a variable:
```c
int x = 3;
int *i_ptr = &x; // i_ptr is a pointer to the memory location of 'x'
```
---
Memory is laid out something like this:

location | value
---------|------
`0x00`   |
`0x01`   |
`0x02`   |
`0x03`   |

And a variable is just named memory address:

```c
int x = 3; // the compiler picks a memory location. Let's say: 0x01
```

location | value
---------|------
`0x00`   |
`0x01`   | `3`
`0x02`   |
`0x03`   |

<small><small>In real life, you don't have to know the memory location for variables. This is just for demonstration.</small></small>
---
If we create a pointer that points to variable `x`:
```c
int *i_ptr = &x; // so, i_ptr has to contain 0x01.
```
`i_ptr` is a **variable**, and also **has a location in memory.** Let's say `0x02`.

location | value
---------|------
`0x00`   |
`0x01`   | `3`
`0x02`   | `0x01`
`0x03`   |

If we decided to create an integer pointer pointer (`int **`) to point to `i_ptr`:
```c
int **ii_ptr = &i_ptr; // lets say ii_ptr is 0x03
```
location | value
---------|------
`0x00`   |
`0x01`   | `3`
`0x02`   | `0x01`
`0x03`   | `0x02`
---
class: center, middle, dark
# Great, now we have a pointer to a pointer to an integer. But how do we get the value out?
---
This is were the dereference operator '`*`' comes into play.

`*` dereferences (or follows) a pointer to the location it points to:
```c
int y = *i_ptr; // gives us the value of what i_ptr points to
int z = **ii_ptr; // gives follows the first pointer,
                  // then follows the second pointer to the value.
```

I like to think of a pointer as a directory and the value as a file.
```
─── ii_ptr
    └── i_ptr
        └── x
```
Then, '`*`' would move down a directory and '`&`' would move up a directory.
---
Wait, but what about multiple files! That would break the analogy!
```
─── ii_ptr
    └── i_ptr
        ├── x
        └── y
```

Actually, this is how arrays are handled in C. A C array is a set of consecutive memory addresses. The first value is pointed to by a pointer.

```c
int a[] = {1, 2, 3}; // create an array
// a is just a pointer to the first element...
int first_val = *a; //... so dereferencing it will give us the first value.
int second_val = *(a + 1); // get the next memory address (a + 1),
                           // then follow (or step into) that memory address ('*')
int third_value = a[2]; // this is just syntactic sugar for *(a + 2)
```

# There's a limitation to C arrays.
---
class: center, middle, dark
# They aren't dynamic.
---
class: center, middle, dark
# You want to push a new element to the end of an array?
---
class: center, middle, dark
# Guess what, bucko?
---
class: center, middle, dark
# You have to *manually* allocate space for the new value
---
# `malloc` and `realloc`
*Manually allocating space in memory since 1972.*

`malloc` takes one argument: the number of bytes that need to be allocated.

`sizeof(int)` returns the number of bytes in an integer, which we multiply by the number of elements in the array.
```c
int num_of_elements = 3;
int *resize_arr = malloc(sizeof(int) * num_of_elements);
// ... put stuff in it ...
```
To make room for a new element:
```c
resize_arr = realloc(resize_arr, sizeof(int) * (num_of_elements + 1));
```
The first argument is the pointer to reallocate, the second is the new size of the pointer.

Don't forget to free it when you're done:
```c
free(resize_arr);
```

# And finally
---
class: center, middle, dark
# a concept that not difficult to understand
---
class: center, middle, dark
# but foundational
---
class: center, middle, dark
# C doesn't care about your data
---
# What does that mean?
C doesn't give a flying crap about your types. You want to cast your integer to a char? Go ahead:
```c
char letter = 'a';
int x = (int) a; // look. it's now an int
```

A pointer to an integer:
```c
int x = 3;
int *ptr = &x;
int y = (int) ptr;
```
Does it throw a warning because ints aren't the same size as pointers? Yes. Does it make sense? No. Does C still cast it? Yes.

Using an image library and want to cast an int to the first pixel? Go ahead:
```c
#include <img_lib.h>
int num = 30;
image *my_img = load_raw_image("./test.png");
my_img[0][0] = (pixel) num;
```

# And that covers the all difficult C concepts for beginners
---
# What you should remember
- C sees the world as a bunch of random bytes
- Pointers are just addresses. They are variables too.
- Arrays are collections of consecutive memory locations
---
# More resources for learning
